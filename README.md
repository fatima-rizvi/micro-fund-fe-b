## API

See API documentation [here](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/micro-fund-be-b/blob/main/README.md).

## React Query

Microfund uses [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview) to manage state. This implementation has three major parts:

### Client
`src/index.js` creates the query client, which stores state. The `QueryClientProvider` component, like a Redux `Provider`, provides the query client to all of the app's components. The `defaultOptions` field contains global settings for React Query.
```js
  const queryClient = new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
      queries: {
        refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
        staleTime: 600000,
      },
    },
  });
```

### Queries
`src/components/common/Profile.js` implements a sample query.

`currentUser` is the query key. If multiple components have queries referring to the same key, React Query treats them as the same query. If the app received a reply to that query earlier it will reuse that data rather than sending a new request.

Because the user profile is editable, we must declare local state `userData` to store user input. The `useEffect` hook feeds information from the query to local state when the query is updated.

```js
  const { isLoading, data, error } = useQuery('currentUser', () => {
    return axiosWithAuth(auth.authState.accessToken).get('/users/getuserinfo');
  });

  // transfer results of query into local state (for editable fields)
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState(defaultUserData);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (data?.data) {
      setUserData(data.data);
    }
  }, [data]);
```

### Mutations
`src/components/common/Profile.js` implements a mutation, which React Query uses to modify server state.

`patchUser` is a wrapper for the HTTP request itself, in this case an Axios `.patch` call using the Okta accessToken and a local state variable. (See `userData` above.)

`mutation` applies React Query settings to the request. For example, `onSuccess` is a callback function invoked when the server sends back a reply with a successful (2xx) status. `invalidateQueries` tells React Query that the "currentUser" query result (see above) is out of date.

The event handler uses `mutation.mutate()` to invoke the request with all of its React Query settings.

```js
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  // mutation
  const patchUser = () => {
    return axiosWithAuth(auth.authState.accessToken).patch(
      `users/user/${userData.userid}`,
      userData
    );
  };

  const mutation = useMutation(patchUser, {
    onSuccess: () => {
      // when user data is successfully changed, notify query client that it should refetch user data
      queryClient.invalidateQueries('currentUser');
    },
  });

  // event handlers
  const submitUserData = () => {
    mutation.mutate();
  };
```
